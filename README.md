!!! Program working ONLY on WINDOWS!!!

How to use this program:

1. In the first line, replace YOUR_WEBHOOK with your Discord webhook. You can find guides on how to do this, e.g. on YouTube
2. Copy all code (Ctrl A)
2. Open powershell
3. Paste program (Ctrl V)
4. Click 'Paste anyway'
5. Done. Wait until a message arrives on Discord or the window does not close.


If code does not work:
1. Check if you have an internet connection
2. Check if the webhook is correct, to be sure, regenerate it.
3. If something red is displayed while the program is running, report it in the Issues tab, I'll try to fix it.
